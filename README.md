# SubZone
**```HTTP(S)-Subdomains,Dns records, & More!```**
* All **registered** subdomains!
* All **active** subdomains!
* All **Dns records**!
* Is **non-intrusive** - leave **NO fingerprints**, *totally fast and totally anonymous.*

**SubZone** - Gathers all registered subdomains for target domain, and then checks too see which ones are active subdomains, 
also will go through dns servers and do zonetransfer to see if any server have been miss configured and are leaking valuable
information.

* Owner/sys-admin email.
* Owner contact info.
* Server contact info.
* Ip addresses.
* Port numbers
* Telephone numbers.
* Location of server.
* Other servers
* Software.
* & more!.
*(Check out dns record pics for zonetransfer.me at bottom of page for example)*

This helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains and information for the domain they are targeting. 

## Getting Started

Either Fork the latest repository or use pip to get latest version of subzone.
For easy install of python package and all dependencies use - *pip install subzone*

**Key points**
* Arguments are **-d** *(For domain)* & **-o** *(For output file)*
* Use http(s) in your domain.  ~  *Ex. -d https://example.com (Not https://www.example.com)*
* Specifying domain name is *NOT* optional.  ~  *Ex. -d https://example.com*
* Specifying output file *is* optional.  ~  *Ex. -o example.txt* 

**Can also be used as an import to your own script/program** 
*from subdomain import subzone*
then use **subzone.get(url)** eg. subzone.get('https://facebook.com')
Will print out a list of registered domains and active domains - in color - 

**Example Usage:**
```
-d (domain) is True(needed)  -o (output) is True (needed) - 
- python subzone_v2.0.py -d (domain) -o (output)
- python subzone_v2.0.py -d https://facebook.com -o facebook.txt
- python subzone_v2.0.py -d https://zonetransfer.me -o zonetransfer.txt
```

- *100%*: You will get everything that can be possibly got from the domain/host all whilst leaving **NO** fingerprints.
